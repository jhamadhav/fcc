                Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam; 15 October 1931 – 27 July
                2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and politician who served as the 11th President of India from
                2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
                engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the
                Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and
                was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.
                He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic
                missile and launch vehicle technology.He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and
                political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by
                India in 1974.
                <br><br>
                Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya
                Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's
                President", he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single
                term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest
                civilian honour.
                <br><br>
                While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from
                an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands, including national-level dignitaries,
                attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameshwaram, where he was buried with full state
                honours.

                After leaving office, Kalam became a visiting professor at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong,
                the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, and the Indian Institute of Management Indore; an honorary
                fellow of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore; chancellor of the Indian Institute of Space
                Science and Technology Thiruvananthapuram; professor of Aerospace Engineering at Anna University; and an
                adjunct at many other academic and research institutions across India. He taught information technology
                at the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, and technology at Banaras Hindu
                University and Anna University.

                In May 2012, Kalam launched a programme for the youth of India called the What Can I Give Movement, with
                a central theme of defeating corruption.

                In 2011, Kalam was criticised by civil groups over his stand on the Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant; he
                supported the establishment of the nuclear power plant and was accused of not speaking with the local
                people. The protesters were hostile to his visit as they saw him as a pro-nuclear scientist and were
                unimpressed by the assurances he provided regarding the safety features of the .<a
